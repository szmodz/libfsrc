To build libfsrc you need to use CMake. CMake will generate the needed Makefiles / Project files for both *NIX and Windows environments.

You will need FFTW (www.fftw.org) to build and use the library.

Under Windows, CMake will generally be unable to locate the dependencies automatically, so you'll need to point it.

FFTW_INCLUDE_DIR -> directory containing fftw3.h
FFTW_LIBRARY -> the fftw3.lib (or whatever it's called) file
FFTWF_LIBRARY -> fftw3f.lib 

Prebuilt dependencies for Windows are available for download on the project's sourceforge page

oh and under *nix the cmake script doesn't actually generate an install target, so you'll just have to copy it wherever you want it, until I or someone fixes it.
